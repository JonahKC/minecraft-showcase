# Here's Some Examples of What We've Done:

@Turnip1234 made a mod (with the textures being drawn by a friend) for the Forge mod loader on Java Edition, adding an item called the "Tuiver," which is an effective method of storing up to four stacks of torches for your mining sessions. The code is all original.

## In terms of bedrock content, we've cooperated on numerous things including:
- A behavior pack that gives you the ability to undo, in case you've accidentally blown up your house and killed your dog, you can just undo it all and forget it ever happened.
- Another behavior pack that adds small, simple things inspired by [ItemBound](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/itembound-16x) for Java Edition. Examples include dynamic lighting when holding torches, creepers drop creeper pelt, pigs drop pig leather, and zombies drop digested flesh. It also adds custom death messages, as a replacement for the vanilla ones.

## We've both recently been cooperating on an extremely work-in-progress minigame server with support for Java AND Bedrock players with [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/)
