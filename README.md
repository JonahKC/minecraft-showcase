# Here's Some Examples of What We've Done, sorted by version:

## Java
- @Turnip1234 made a mod (with the textures being drawn by a friend) for the Forge mod loader on Java Edition, adding an item called the "Tuiver," which is an effective method of storing up to four stacks of torches for your mining sessions. The code is all original. You can try this out by downloading the Communalreards jar file, and using it with the Forge Mod Loader on Minecraft 1.16.4/5

- We worked for about a month on a now-discontinued extremely work-in-progress minigame server hosted on a Microsoft Azure UbuntuSever VM with support for Java & Bedrock players via [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/)

## Bedrock
- We built another behavior pack that adds small, simple things inspired by the Java pack [ItemBound](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/itembound-16x). Examples include dynamic lighting when holding torches, creepers drop creeper pelt, pigs drop pig leather, and zombies drop digested flesh. It also adds custom death messages, as a replacement for the vanilla ones.

## Education Edition
- @JonahKC built a historically accurate to-scale model of the Shirtwaist Factory Fire, and the buildings around it. @Turnip1234 brought it to life with an interactive system where after you talk to enough people (with real names of people who worked there and dialouge based off of books, quotes, and other historical documents), the building catches on fire.
